# Nexus Contributors Guide

Hey ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for making or considering to make a contribution to Nexus. This document assumes you are already familiar with Nexus. If not, then before contributing you might want to brush up on what Nexus is. Start [here](http://nexusjs.org).

There are many ways you can help:

- Get active in [community discussions](https://nxs.li/discussions) and help other users
- [Create bug reports](https://nxs.li/issues/create/bug) when you find an issue
- [Create feature requests](https://nxs.li/issues/create/feature) when you hit a use-case that isn't served well or at all
- Improve the documentation

If you want to contribute code, that's awesome! Here's how to do that.

<br/>

#### Code Architecture

##### Overview

- Roughly speaking we have three distinct levels of code:

  1. `src/{cli, framework}` Top level modules coded directly against their respective domain.

  2. `src/utils/*` Mid level modules that might provide some conveniences or encapsulate concerns shared across `framework` and `cli`.

  3. `src/lib/*` Discrete modules that stand alone conceptually and technically.

- Each level builds on the one below it.

- One can think of code as evolving from level 1 down toward level 3.

  Of course the natural place for some code is level 1. On the other hand we often don't know at first what a generic solution looks like. So level 3 tends to be grown into, rather than started from.

- You could see a level 4 here as npm registry, where we _fully_ extract a library. That is not an explicit goal, just a tip for the mental model.

- Overall status of the codebase is in a state of refactoring. `utils`, `watcher`, and more are undergoing source restructuring in the near future.

##### Layout Overview

```
/docs         -- The website
/test         -- Integration tests
/src
  /cli        -- CLI codebase
  /framework  -- Runtime codebase
  /utils      -- Non-discrete modules (may have state, tight coupling)
  /lib        -- Discrete modules
```

##### `lib`

The layout of a typical lib module looks like so:

```
/lib
  /<module-name>
    /index.ts        -- Export-only module, the public interface
    /index.spec.ts   -- Tests against the public interface. Integration in the sense
                        that it is agnostic to the unit or units making up the lib.
    /*.ts            -- The modules making up the lib
    /*.spec.ts       -- Optional tests. Please prioritize `index.spec.ts`
```

Be careful about lib modules depending upon one another excessively. The more complex the dependency graph the harder it _can_ become to reason about the modules. But if there is non-trivial re-use to be had and/or just a simple/clean and logical dependency then go for it.

The built-in exception to this heuristic is `lib/utils` which can be thought of as a bespoke `lodash` for our lib components. Use it for small utilities, which might be shared, are very generic, and are not numerous enough to justify their own dedicated lib module. For example there is a utility to make text span a given length using given pad character.

#### Testing

We use GitHub Actions.

##### Unit

```bash
yarn test:unit
yarn dev:test      # watch mode
```

- Live under `/src` separated by and colocated with the respective module they test.

- Unit tests run in CI against every commit.

- /!\ Make sure you have compiled `nexus` with `yarn build` before running the watcher unit tests

##### System

```
yarn test system/create-prisma
yarn test system/kitchen
```

- Live under `/test/system`

- Almost like E2E but they work with the local package code (whereas E2E would work with an actually published package).

- These are useful because they provide many of the functional checks of E2E with a lower barrier to running, namely needing a published package. For example pull-requests made by community members cannot trigger E2E tests because that would require publishing and GitHub actions has no way for [PRs from forks to access secrets](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Allow-secrets-to-be-shared-with-trusted-Actions/td-p/34278).

- You must run `yarn build` right before running these tests.

##### E2E

```
yarn test e2e/create-prisma
yarn test e2e/kitchen
```

- Live under `/test/e2e`

- The `E2E_NEXUS_VERSION` envar controls which version of Nexus to install during app creation

- The `create-prisma` e2e test always uses the `next` version of `nexus-plugin-prisma`. This is so that pre-releases can be made to fix Nexus PRs ([example](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/pull/859)).

- E2E tests run in CI against every commit _after the package has been published_. These are preview and pr releases so its acceptable, and doing it this way provides a true smoke test of if the _real_ user journey works end to end.

- E2E tests can be run on your machine. They default to working with `latest` dist-tag. Use `E2E_NEXUS_VERSION` env var to set the desired version to test against.

#### Continuous Delivery

- We use [`dripip`](https://github.com/prisma-labs/dripip) to make releases.

- Every PR commit results in:

  1. Pre-Release of pattern:

     ```
     0.0.0-pr.<pr-num>.<build-num>.<short-sha>`
     ```

  1. Update to an npm dist tag of pattern

     ```
     pr.<pr-num>`
     ```

- Every trunk commit results in a

  1. Pre-Release of pattern:

     ```
     <next-version>-next.<build-num>
     ```

  1. Update to an npm dist tag of pattern

     ```
     next
     ```

- Stable releases are cut _manually_.

- Any release type can be run manually:

  ```
  yarn release:preview
  yarn release:stable
  yarn release:pr
  ```

#### Website & Documentation

##### Where Things Are

- The main website is at https://nexusjs.org
- The website is powered by [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)
- The website is deployed to Netlify
- The website source lives under `/website`
- The Documentation source lives under `/website/content`
- You should not touch website source other than content. It is managed by the Prisma web team.

##### Deployment

- Any content changes in a PR will get deployed to a preview URL
- Any content changes that land on trunk will be automatically deployed to production

##### Content Change Guidelines

- We use the Prisma style guide https://www.prisma.io/docs/more/style-guide
- All MDX components documented there are usable here
- The website is not versioned. The website content should always reflect the current nexus stable release. It should never reflect the Nexus canary release. Until we have a way on the website to select which version of the docs to read you must use the follow documentation content update protocol:

  - A PR should not touch the website docs in anyway that would make it untrue for current Nexus stable users.
  - A PR that makes it so documentation needs or should be updated should be done a separate documentation PR.
  - There is exactly ONE documentation PR per sprint.
  - If your PR is the first of the sprint that requires documentation changes and thus there is no documentation PR yet open for that sprint then you should open that PR yourself.
  - The PR branch should be `chore/website-documentation`
  - The PR title should be `chore(website): documentation updates`.
  - The documentation PR will be merged immediately after a stable has been cut.

##### Developing Locally

```
cd website
yarn
yarn dev
```

#### Workflow Tips

##### Working With Example Apps via Linking

Refer to https://github.com/graphql-nexus/examples

##### Developing `create app`

The strategy is to use a file path for the nexus dependency.

The pattern is thus:

```
CREATE_APP_CHOICE_NEXUS_VERSION='<path/to/nexus>' node <path/to/nexus>/dist/cli/main.js create app
```
