## Overview

The Nexus server component supports two modes: "serverful" and "serverless" (experimental).

## Serverless

Nexus has **experimental** support for serverless deployments. Support for serverless is being tracked in [GitHub issue #782](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/issues/782).

> **Note**: API documentation for the serverless features is not yet available.

The server component of Nexus exposes HTTP request handlers:

```ts
import { server } from 'nexus'

server.handlers.graphql // call with (req, res)
```

Use these to handle to requests in your serverless environment:

```ts
import { server } from 'nexus'

export default (req, res) => {
  server.handlers.graphql(req, res)
}
```

See the [Next.JS example](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/examples/tree/master/with-nextjs) for a functioning serverless reference.
