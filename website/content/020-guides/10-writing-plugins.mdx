title: Writing Plugins
---

## Overview

- Writing plugins is an expressive and exciting part of Nexus
- But please note that it is one of the least stable components
- Not just in terms of lack of polish or unstable APIs but entire concepts and architecture
- The bar to a finished stable plugin system is high not just because plugin systems are in general challenging, but also because the thing which it permits extending is itself not stable either: the framework components exposed at the application layer
- If you are embarking on creating a plugin, please be aware you are in uncharted territory with no guarantees about API stability or even entire concepts/ways of extending Nexus
- If you are ok with that, we welcome you aboard this journey and hope you share your feedback with the team on GitHub and creations with the community on slack!

## How it looks

The Nexus CLI has a command to create new Nexus-plugin projects

```bash-symbol
nexus create plugin
```

To write a plugin you create any of `testtime` `runtime` and `worktime` modules and import the respective plugin types to type your function. In each module export your plugin as `plugin`.

```ts
// runtime.ts
import { RuntimePlugin } from 'nexus/plugin'

export const plugin: RuntimePlugin = () => project => {
  /* ... */
}
```

```ts
// testtime.ts
import { TesttimePlugin } from 'nexus/plugin'

export const plugin: TesttimePlugin = () => project => {
  /* ... */
}
```

```ts
// worktime.ts
import { WorktimePlugin } from 'nexus/plugin'

export const plugin: WorktimePlugin = () => project => {
  /* ... */
}
```

The `project` parameter gives you access to utils and core components

```ts
export const plugin: TesttimePlugin = () => project => {
  project.utils.log.trace('hello')
}
```

With runtime plugins you can pass configuration to Nexus and contribute toward the graphql resolver context:

```ts
export const plugin: RuntimePlugin = () => project => {
  return {
    context: {
      create: req => {
        return {
          token: req.headers.authorization.match(/^Bearer (.+)$/)?[1] ?? null
          }
        },
        typeGen: {
          fields: {
            token: 'null | string'
          }
        }
      },
      schema: {
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With worktime plugins you can hook onto various events grouped by sub-system:

```ts
export const plugin: WorktimePlugin = () => project => {
  // Not all hooks shown here
  project.hooks.build.onStart = async () => { ... }
  project.hooks.create.onAfterBaseSetup = async () => { ... }
  project.hooks.generate.onStart = async () => { ... }
  project.hooks.dev.onStart = async () => { ... }
  project.hooks.dev.onFileWatcherEvent = async () => { ... }
  project.hooks.dev.addToSettings = { ... }
  project.hooks.db.init.onStart = async () => { ... }
  project.hooks.db.migrate.apply = async () => { ... }
  project.hooks.db.plan.onStart = async () => { ... }
  project.hooks.db.rollback.onStart = async () => { ... }
  project.hooks.db.ui.onStart = async () => { ... }
}
```

Some worktime hooks give you contextual information to reflect upon:

```ts
export const plugin: WorktimePlugin = () => project => {
  project.hooks.db.plan.onStart = async ctx => {
    project.log.info(ctx.migrationName)
  }
})
```

Finally, for your plugin to be consumed by Nexus, you need to export an entrypoint which references your runtime or worktime or testtime plugin.

**This entrypoint is what needs to be imported by users.**

We recommend you named export the entrypoint after the suffix `nexus-plugin-(*)` of your npm package name.

For instance, if your plugin is named `nexus-plugin-fancy-plugin`, your entrypoint should be named export `fancyPlugin`

```ts
import { PluginEntrypoint } from 'nexus/plugin'

export const fancyPlugin: PluginEntrypoint = () => ({
  packageJsonPath: require.resolve('../package.json'),
  runtime: {
    module: require.resolve('./runtime'),
    export: 'plugin',
  },
  worktime: {
    module: require.resolve('./worktime'),
    export: 'plugin',
  },
  testtime: {
    module: require.resolve('./testtime'),
    export: 'plugin',
  },
})
```

## Adding settings to your plugin

1. Create a `settings.ts` file and export a type `Settings` containing your settings

   ```ts
   // settings.ts
   export type Settings = {
     myCustomOption?: boolean
   }
   ```

2. Import the `Settings` type in your entrypoint, and pass it as generic to `PluginEntrypoint`.

   > **Note**: You must return the settings untouched in your entrypoint. The framework is then responsible for passing the settings to your runtime/worktime/testtime plugins .

   ```ts
   //entrypoint.ts
   import { PluginEntrypoint } from 'nexus/plugin'
   import { Settings } from './settings'

   export const fancyPlugin: PluginEntrypoint<Settings> = settings => ({
     settings,
     ...
   })
   ```

3. Repeat the operation for your runtime/worktime/testtime plugins.

   ```ts
   // runtime.ts
   import { RuntimePlugin } from 'nexus/plugin'
   import { Settings } from './settings'

   export const plugin: RuntimePlugin<Settings> = settings => project => {
     // ...
   }
   ```

By default, settings will always be optional.

**We strongly recommend you keep it that way and find defaults for each of your settings.** This is in order to keep the framework zero-config as much as possible. If you really need required settings though, you can enable them in the following way:

```ts
// entrypoint.ts
import { PluginEntrypoint } from 'nexus/plugin'
import { Settings } from './settings'

export const fancyPlugin: PluginEntrypoint<Settings, 'required'> = settings => ({
  settings,
  // ...
})

// runtime.ts
import { RuntimePlugin } from 'nexus/plugin'
import { Settings } from './settings'

export const plugin: RuntimePlugin<Settings, 'required'> = settings => project => {
  // ...
}
```

## Wholistic

- The breadth of Nexus' plugin system is uncommon
- Most tools are either runtime (Express) or workflow (ESLint) oriented and thus naturally scope their plugins to their focus
- the advantage of Nexus' approach where plugins can hook into both workflow and runtime is that they allow plugin authors to deliver rich wholistic experiences for their users
- For example a plugin author might reinforce their plugin's runtime feature with additions to doctor which lint for idiomatic usage
- No longer does a plugin need rely on a lengthy readme that probably isn't complete and probably isn't read by most users to guide users through correct configuration, etc. usage of their plugin
- Nexus is fanatic about giving as much latitude as possible to plugin authors to craft plugins that forward the principal of the pit of success to Nexus app developers

## Runtime vs worktime

- runtime is for hooking into when your app is actually running
- so logic here can directly impact your production systems' reliability and performance characteristics
- worktime is for hooking into things like dev testing and building
- logic here is relatively free from concern over runtime impact, e.g. some slow running build-time extensions cannot impact latency experienced by end-users of the app in production.

## Publishing for consumption

- You must name your plugin package `nexus-plugin-<your-plugin-name>`
- Nexus plugin cli will rely on this convention to search install etc. plugins ([todo](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/issues/155))
- Nexus relies on this pattern to auto-use plugins in a user's project

## A code reference

- The most sophisticated real-world Nexus plugin is `nexus-plugin-prisma`.
- It currently drives many of the requirements of the plugin system where we want nexus-prisma users to feel prisma is as seamless a component as any core one.
