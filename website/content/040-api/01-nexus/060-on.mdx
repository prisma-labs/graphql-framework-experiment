## `import { on } from 'nexus`

[Guide](/guides/lifecycle)

The lifecycle component is designed for tapping into app events. This can be useful when you need to run eager code that wouldn't play well with Nexus' [reflection system](/guides/lifecycle#reflection). If you are new to this component then you may be interested in our [lifecycle guide](/guides/lifecycle).

## start

Register callback to be run when the application starts.

#### Signature

```ts
(data: {
  schema: NexusGraphQLSchema
}) => void
```

#### Example

```ts
import { on, log } from 'nexus'

on.start(data => {
  log.info('app started', { schema: data.schema })
})
```

#### Remarks

Put initialization code here that you don't want run during [Nexus refletion](/guides/lifecycle#reflection).
