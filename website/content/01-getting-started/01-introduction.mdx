# Introduction {docsify-ignore}

<p class='NextIs Note'></p>

Nexus is a delightful framework for building GraphQL APIs in Node. It leverages TypeScript and knowledge about your data sources and API schema to give you levels of type safety that until now you've probably never experienced.

### Features

- Pervasive zero-config philosophy.
- You are free to use the API where and how you see fit. Few conventions on how to structure your app.
- GraphQL schema construction
  - Define your schema in code, abstract repeated patterns.
  - Integrated helpers for building Relay compliant pagination
  - Define graphql types without export/import and configuration boilerplate.
- Type safety made simple
  - Automatically fully typed GraphQL resolvers accounting for what you see in the `parent`, `args`, `ctx` arguments and what you're allowed to return.
  - Automatically extracted types from return values in your `addToContext` invocations are merged into the Nexus resolver context type.
  - Export any type in any module to make it available as a backing type for any object in your GraphQL schema.
- Integrated logger component built atop Pino
  - Pretty mode for development
  - JSON mode for production
  - Automatic request-scoped child logger available on context object

### Limitations

We plan to lift these limitations one day.

- Lacks good Windows support [issues](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/labels/platform%2Fwindows)
- Does not work with JavaScript [#85](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/issues/85)
- Does not cover the entire GraphQL Spec
  - Subscriptions [#447](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/issues/447)
  - Interface Extensions [#713](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/issues/713)

### Non-Goals

We do not plan to lift these limitations.

- Works with Node v9 and below
