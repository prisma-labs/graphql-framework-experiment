Testing is a first-class concern of Nexus. So far we ship a few primitives to help you run integration tests, but you can expect integrated higher level testing features in the future.

> Note: This guide is written using [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/) because it is what we use internally and thus can speak to best. But you should be able to use your test framework of choice.

## Meet the Module

Nexus comes with a special testing module that you can import from `nexus/testing`. Its primary utility is the `createTestContext` function. It is designed for running _integration_ tests. When run it will in turn boot your app (in the same process) and expose an interface for your tests to interact with it.

<!-- TODO would be nice to have the TS type shown here. Use doc extraction system to do this. -->

> For the curious...  
> Since `jest` runs test suites in parallel it means multiple instances of your `app` will be run in parallel too. The testing module takes care of abstracting the mechanics of making this work from you. For example it assigns random ports to each app to run its server and makes sure each test suite's app client is configured to be talking with its respective app instance. You should _never_ have to think about these kinds of details though, and if it turns out you do please open a GitHub issue so we can try to seal the leak you've found in Nexus' abstraction!

##### A Little Helper {docsify-ignore}

Before jumping into test suites we will wrap the `createTestContext` with a pattern that more tightly integrates it into `jest`. Nexus will probably ship something like as follows or better in the future, but for now you can copy this into your projects:

```ts
// tests/__helpers.ts
import { createTestContext as originalCreateTestContext, TestContext } from 'nexus/testing'

export function createTestContext(): TestContext {
  let ctx = {} as TestContext

  beforeAll(async () => {
    Object.assign(ctx, await originalCreateTestContext())
    await ctx.app.start()
  })

  afterAll(async () => {
    await ctx.app.stop()
  })

  return ctx
}
```

We'll use this in other test suites roughly like so:

```ts
// tests/foo.spec.ts
import { createTestContext } from './__helpers'

const ctx = createTestContext()

it('foo', () => {
  // use `ctx` in here
})
```

Removing boilerplate away from your test code is a win and staying DRY about it across multiple test suites helps. But do note that `ctx` is not usable outside of jest blocks (`it` `before` `after` `...`). If you try to you'll find it to be `undefined`.

```ts
import { createTestContext } from './__helpers'

const { app } = createTestContext() // Error!
```

## Test Context interface

The Test context interface is extensible by plugins. By default it includes basic control over the app and a GraphQL client instance ready to send queries and mutations to it.

## Without a database

**Example**

```ts
import { createTestContext } from './__helpers'

const ctx = createTestContext()

it('makes sure a user was registered', async () => {
  // ctx.app.query sends requests to your locally running nexus server
  const result = await ctx.app.query(`
    mutation {
      signupUser(data: { email: "person@email.com", password: "123456" })
    } {
      id
      email
      password
    }
  `)

  const createdUsers = await ctx.app.query(`{ users { id } }`)
  expect(createdUsers).toMatchSnapshot()
})
```

## With a Database

Integration testing with a database can add a lot of complexity to your test suite. But Nexus is in a good position to help since it knows about both test and database domains of your app.

Integration between Nexus' test and database systems is young and still missing many features. Below we will cover some utilities and patterns that you can copy into your project meanwhile.

> Note: This assumes you have [setup a PostgreSQL database running locally](references/recipes?id=localql). You could use any database supported by Prisma though.

1. Install new development dependencies for upcoming test utilities.

   ```cli
   npm install --save-dev nanoid pg jest-environment-node
   ```

1. Create a specialized "jest environment" that will manage a real database for your tests to run against.

   ```ts
   // nexus-test-environment.js
   const { Client } = require('pg')
   const NodeEnvironment = require('jest-environment-node')
   const { nanoid } = require('nanoid')
   const util = require('util')
   const exec = util.promisify(require('child_process').exec)

   const prismaBinary = './node_modules/.bin/prisma'

   /**
    * Custom test environment for nexus and Postgres
    */
   class PrismaTestEnvironment extends NodeEnvironment {
     constructor(config) {
       super(config)

       // Generate a unique schema identifier for this test context
       this.schema = `test_${nanoid()}`

       // Generate the pg connection string for the test schema
       this.connectionString = `postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/testing?schema=${this.schema}`
     }

     async setup() {
       // Set the required environment variable to contain the connection string
       // to our database test schema
       process.env.POSTGRES_URL = this.connectionString
       this.global.process.env.POSTGRES_URL = this.connectionString

       // Run the migrations to ensure our schema has the required structure
       await exec(`${prismaBinary} migrate up --experimental`)

       return super.setup()
     }

     async teardown() {
       // Drop the schema after the tests have completed
       const client = new Client({
         connectionString: this.connectionString,
       })
       await client.connect()
       await client.query(`DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS "${this.schema}" CASCADE`)
       await client.end()
     }
   }

   module.exports = PrismaTestEnvironment
   ```

1. Update your jest config to use your new test environment.

   ```diff
   +++ jest.config.ts
   const { join } = require('path')

   module.exports = {
     preset: 'ts-jest',
     rootDir: 'tests',
   + testEnvironment: join(__dirname, 'nexus-test-environment.js'),
   }
   ```

1. Edit your `schema.prisma` file to use an environment variable.

   ```diff
   +++ schema.prisma
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
   -  url      = "postresql://..."
   +  url      = env("POSTGRES_URL")
   }
   ```

1. Create a `.env` file at the root of your project directory and add the following.

   ```
   POSTGRES_URL="<your-development-postgres-url>"
   ```

1. `nexus-plugin-prisma` augment `TestContext['app']` with a `db` property. This can be used for example to seed your database with data at the beginning of a test suite:

   ```ts
   beforeAll(async () => {
     await ctx.app.db.users.createOne({ ... })
   })
   ```

1. For now, just update the `createTestContext` wrapper to integrate your app's db client:

   ```diff
   +++ nexus-test-environment.js
   afterAll(async () => {
     await ctx.app.server.stop()
   + await ctx.app.db.client.disconnect()
   })
   ```

1. That's it. Despite adding a database to your integration tests, they are essentially no more complex than without a databse, which is great. Of course they will run a bit slower now.

   We will cover seeding your test database with data in in the future iteration of this guide.

   ```ts
   // tests/user.test.ts

   import { createTestContext } from './__helpers'

   const ctx = createTestContext()

   it('makes sure a user was registered', async () => {
     // ctx.app.query sends requests to your locally running nexus server
     const result = await ctx.app.query(`
       mutation {
         signupUser(data: { email: "person@email.com", password: "123456" })
       } {
         id
         email
         password
       }
     `)

     const createdUsers = await ctx.app.query(`{ users { id } }`)
     expect(createdUsers).toMatchSnapshot()
   })
   ```
