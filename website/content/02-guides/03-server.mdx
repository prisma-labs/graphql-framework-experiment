## Overview

The Nexus server component supports two modes: "serverful" and "serverless" (experimental).

## Serverless

Nexus has **experimental** support for serverless deployments. Support for serverless is being tracked in [GitHub issue #782](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/issues/782).

> **Note**: API documentation for the serverless features is not yet available.

The server component of Nexus exposes HTTP request handlers:

```ts
import { server } from 'nexus'

server.handlers.graphql // call with (req, res)
server.handlers.playground // call with (req, res)
```

Use these to handle to requests in your serverless environment:

```ts
import { server } from 'nexus'

export default (req, res) => {
  server.handlers.graphql(req, res)
}
```

See the [Next.JS example](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/examples/tree/master/with-nextjs) for a functioning serverless reference.

## Serverfull

In `nexus` you can define both `graph` and `rest` endpoints. By access to express you can for example receive files uploaded to your service. To achieve it you need configure `body-parser`.

```
import { server } from 'nexus'
const bodyParser = require('body-parser')

const app = server.express

app.use(bodyParser.raw({type: 'application/octet-stream', limit: '50mb'}))
app.use(bodyParser.json({type: 'application/json'}))
```

If you want to increase size of body accepted by your endpoints you also achieve it configuring body parser.

```
import { server } from 'nexus'
const bodyParser = require('body-parser')

const app = server.express

app.use(bodyParser.json({type: 'application/json', limit: '1mb'}))
```
