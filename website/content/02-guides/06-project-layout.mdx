## Working With tsconfig.json

- Nexus honours settings within `tsconfig.json`.
- This ensures that Nexus and your IDE perform identical static analysis.
- If no `tsconfig.json` is present then Nexus will scaffold one for you.
- Nexus interacts with `tsconfig.json` in the following ways.

##### Project Root

- Project Root is the CWD (current working directory) for all CLI invocatons.
- Nexus ([like VSCode](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/languages/typescript/#typescript-files-and-projects)) considers the folder containing a `tsconfig.json` to be the project root.

##### Source Root

- Source Root is the base from which your source code layout starts. So, all of your app code must live within the source root. Your JavaScript build output layout will mirror it.
- Source Root is defined by setting `compilerOptions.rootDir` and adding its value also to the `includes` array. For detail into why it works like this see [microsoft/TypeScript#9858](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/9858#issuecomment-533287263) and this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57333825/can-you-pull-in-excludes-includes-options-in-typescript-compiler-api).
- If you do not specify it then Nexus will scaffold its value for you. It will default to being the same directory as where `tsconfig.json` resides. In other words, project root. This default mirrors `tsc` default behaviour. The `includes` array will be scaffolded as well.
- Nexus requires that the `includes` array does not contain modules outside the source root. This mirrors `tsc`.

##### Out Root

- Out Root is the place where the transpiled TypeScript (to JavaScript) modules will be emitted to. The folder structure mimicks that of the source root.
- Out Root is defined by setting `compilerOptions.outDir`.
- If you do not specify it then Nexus will default to `.nexus/build`. Unlike with `rootDir` Nexus will not scaffold the default into your `tsconfig.json` because its presence has no impact upon VSCode.
- You can override its value interactively with `nexus build --out`.

##### Check-Only Builds

if `compilerOptions.noEmit` is set to `true` then Nexus will not output the build. This makes `nexus build` effectively a checker. This option usually [represents user error](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/issues/702) so by default Nexus will warn when this option is used. In the future ([#800](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/issues/800)) there will be ways to disable this the warning if it is really your intent.

##### TypeScript Language Service Plugin

Nexus ships with a TypeScript Language Service Plugin. It currently helps with improved autocomplete experience. In the future it will do more. Nexus will check that you are using it correctly in dev mode. You can see an example of its effect below.

## Conventions

Nexus imposes a few requirements about how you structure your codebase.

### Nexus module(s)

##### Pattern

A file importing `nexus`. eg: `import { schema } from 'nexus'`

##### About

Nexus looks for modules that import `nexus` and uses codegen to statically import them before the server starts.

Beware if you have module-level side-effects coming from something else than Nexus, as these side-effects will always be run when your app starts.

> \*Note: `require` is not supported.

### Entrypoint

##### Pattern

A module, anywhere in your source directory, named `app.ts`.

A custom entrypoint can also be configured using the `--entrypoint` or `-e` CLI option on `nexus build` and `nexus dev`.

##### About

This convention is optional if Nexus modules are present, required otherwise.
