## Devtime Integration

### `nexus dev`

When running `nexus dev`, `nexus-plugin-prisma` will make sure your [`Prisma Client`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-js) is up-to-date with your Prisma Schema by running your Prisma generators for you.

Updates to your `schema.prisma` file will also be detected and will give you hints about the next steps to properly migrate your database.

### `nexus build`

When running `nexus build`, `nexus-plugin-prisma` will make sure your [`Prisma Client`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-js) is up-to-date with your Prisma Schema, thus making sure your application is safely accessing your database.

### `NexusTestContext`

The testing component is augmented with an instance of the [`Prisma Client`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-js), to help you easily seed your database for your tests.

To learn more about its usage, [head to the Testing section](../../guides/testing#with-a-database).
